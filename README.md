WIP text summary script and potential (future) reddit bot/webservice - https://github.com/yangdanny97/summarizer

A basic NLP project that summarizes text. The ultimate goal is to make either a Reddit summary bot, or a text summary web service. 

Currently it can summarize text from a file or from a website (news article extracted with the newspaper library). Code to make this a reddit bot exists, but the summarizing script isn't good or versatile enough to deploy outside of testing.

Required:
- nltk
- newspaper
